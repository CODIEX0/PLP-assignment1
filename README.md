#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


1. **Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**  
   Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development, ensuring that applications are reliable, scalable, and maintainable, which is essential for innovation and efficiency in the technology industry.

2. **Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**  
   Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include the development of the Waterfall model in the 1970s, the introduction of Agile methodologies in the early 2000s, and the rise of DevOps practices to enhance collaboration and automation in the 2010s.

3. **Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**  
   Unit testing checks individual components for correctness, integration testing verifies the interaction between components, system testing evaluates the complete system functionality, and acceptance testing ensures the software meets user needs, all crucial for ensuring software reliability and quality.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

4. **Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**  
   Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input queries to interact effectively with AI models, ensuring accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses.

5. **Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**  
   Vague prompt: "Tell me about dogs."  
   Improved prompt: "Can you provide information about the care and training of puppies?"  
   The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the focus (care and training) and narrows the scope, leading to a more relevant and targeted response.
